      <p><emph>This section describes the status of this
         document at the time of its publication.
         Other documents may supersede this document.
         A list of current W3C publications and the latest
         revision of this technical report can be found in the

      <p>This is one document in a set of eight documents that have progressed to
         Recommendation together (XQuery 1.0, XQueryX 1.0, XSLT 2.0,
         Data Model, Functions and Operators, Formal Semantics,
         Serialization, XPath 2.0). </p>

      <p>This is a <loc
         href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/Process-20040205/tr.html#RecsW3C">Recommendation</loc>
         of the W3C.  It &spec-devby;</p>
 
      <p>This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by
         software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties,
         and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a
         stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from
         another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw
         attention to the specification and to promote its widespread
         deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of
         the Web.</p>
