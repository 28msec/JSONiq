    <h2> JFlex - Frequently Asked Questions

 </h2>
    <p> 
    <UL>
<LI>
<B>Can I use my old JLex specifications with JFlex?</B></LI>

<UL>Yes. You usually can use them unchanged. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Porting">[porting
from JLex]</A> of the manual for more information on that topic.
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>

<LI>
<B>Where can I get the latest version of JFlex?</B></LI>

<UL>Check out the <A HREF="http://www.jflex.de/">JFlex website</A> at
<tt><A HREF="http://www.jflex.de/">http://www.jflex.de</A></tt>.
There is an <a href="http://www.jflex.de/mailing.html">announcement
mailing list</a>, in case you want to be notified of new JFlex releases.
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>

<LI>
<B>What platforms does JFlex support?</B></LI>

<UL>
JFlex is written with Sun's JDK 1.1 and produces JDK 1.1 compatible code.
It should run on any platform that supports JRE/JDK 1.1 or above.
At the <a href="http://www.jflex.de">JFlex website</a>, there is a <a href="http://www.jflex.de/platforms.html">list of platforms</a> JFlex has been positively tested on.

<LI>
<B>My program crashes when I use a large scanner (about 250 states)</B></LI>

<UL>No problem. Just use the <TT>%pack</TT> directive for more compression
of the transition table. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CodeGeneration">[code
generation]</A> of the manual for more information on this topic.
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>

<LI>
<B>I get a java.lang.VerifyError when I start my program with java -verify</B></LI>

<UL>This is in fact the same problem as described above. You can use the
<TT>%pack</TT> directive to avoid it. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CodeGeneration">[code
generation]</A> of the manual for more information on this topic.
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>

<LI>
<B>Can I use CUP and JFlex together?</B></LI>

<UL>You can. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CUPWork">[Working together:
JFlex and CUP]</A> of the manual on how to do it.<BR>&nbsp;</UL>

<LI>
<B>Can I use the generated code of my JFlex specification commercially?</B></LI>

<UL>You can use your generated code without restriction. See the file <A HREF="COPYRIGHT">copyright</A> for more 
information.<BR>&nbsp;</UL>


<LI>
<B>I want my scanner to read from a network byte stream or from interactive stdin. Can I do this with JFlex?</B></LI>

<UL>
This actually depends on the syntax of the input you want to read. The problem is, that for some
expressions the scanner needs one character of lookahead to decide which action to execute.
For interactive use and network streams this is very inconvenient, because the stream 
doesn't send an EOF (or any other data) when the user stops typing while the scanner just waits
for the next character and doesn't return a symbol. Since version 1.1.1 of JFlex this problem
can be avoided because of a little more analysis at generation time. Take a look at these three
rules:<BR>
<tt>1. a</tt><BR>
<tt>2. a*</tt><BR>
<tt>3. ";"</tt><BR>
When the scanner has read one <tt>a</tt>, an additional input character is needed to decide,
if this matches rule 1 (just one <tt>a</tt>) or rule two (when the next character is another
<tt>a</tt>). With input <tt>aaa</tt> the scanner also has to read one additional character,
because it is supposed to return the longest match (so if there comes another <tt>a</tt>, the match
is <tt>aaaa</tt> and not only <tt>aaa</tt>). But: When the scanner reads a "<tt>;</tt>",
it does not need an additional character and can immediatly execute the action for rule 
number 3. This is the case for all rules that are not prefixes of any other rules in the
specification and that have a fixed length end (so <tt>(a* b)</tt> is ok but <tt>(a b*)</tt> is not).
<p>
For your application this means: if all commands (or whatever units of input you have) are
terminated by some delimiter (for instance "<tt>;</tt>" or LF or "<tt>end</tt>") reading from a network bytestream or an interactive stream works fine with JFlex.

<b>How can I let my scanner read its input from a string?</b>
<UL>
<pre>String myString = "some input";
Scanner myScanner = new Scanner( new java.io.StringReader(myString) );
</pre>
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>

<LI>
<b>Why do standalone scanners have a different standard return type (<tt>int</tt> instead 
   of <tt>Yytoken</tt>)?</b>
<UL>
That's because <tt>int</tt> is a predefined type in Java and <tt>Yytoken</tt> is not. If a scanner
generated with <tt>%standalone</tt> option would have return type <tt>Yytoken</tt>, you would have
to provide this class for every standalone scanner you write. In most cases you don't want to do that,
because the scanner wouldn't be really <em>standalone</em> then. 
The standard <tt>Yytoken</tt> for non standalone 
cases stems from JLex and is only kept for compatibility (it's rarely used anyway).
If you still <em>really</em> want <tt>Yytoken</tt> as return type in a standalone scanner, you can always
explicitly specify it with <tt>%type Yytoken</tt>. If you just want to test your scanner scanner and see what
it does without a parser attached, use <tt>%debug</tt> instead of <tt>%standalone</tt>.

<b>The expression <tt>.*$</tt> used to work, but now JFlex complains about trailing context</b>
<UL>
This is because <tt>.*$</tt> is now matched with the more general lookahead operator <tt>/</tt> and is
equivalent to <tt>.* / \r|\n|\r\n</tt>. The problem with this expression is that the character class
<tt>.</tt> contains the <tt>\r</tt> character and therefore matches the beginning of the trailing context.
Earlier versions of JFlex used a special implementation for <tt>$</tt> and had no lookahead operator.<br>
A simple workaround is not to use the <tt>.</tt> class, but to use the expression <tt>[^\r\n]</tt> 
instead (so the full expression is now <tt>[^\r\n]*$</tt> and should work without error).

<LI>
<b>I use <tt>%8bit</tt> and get an Exception, but I know my platform
only uses 8 bit. Is <tt>%8bit</tt> broken?</b>
<UL>
Short answer: not broken, use <tt>%unicode</tt>. Long answer:
Most probably this is an encoding problem. Java uses Unicode internally and converts
the bytes it reads from files (or somewhere else) to Unicode first. The 8 bit value
of your platform may not be 8 bit anymore when converted to Unicode. On many Windozes
for instance Cp1252 (Windows-Latin-1) is used as standard encoding, and there the 
character "single right quotation mark" has code <tt>\x92</tt> but after conversion to
Unicode it's <tt>\u2019</tt> which is not 8 bit any more. See also the section
on <a href="manual.html#sec:encodings">Encodings, platforms, and Unicode</a> of the JFlex 
manual for more information.

<LI>
<b>My scanner needs to read a file that is not in my platforms standard encoding, but in encoding XYZ. How?</b>
<UL>
Since the scanner reads Java Unicode characters, it is independent
of the actual character encoding a file or a string uses. The
transformation byte-stream to Java characters for files 
usually happens in the <tt>java.io.InputStreamReader</tt> 
object connected with the input stream. Class 
<tt>java.io.FileReader</tt> uses the platforms default 
encoding automatically. If you would like to explicitly
specify another encoding, for instance UTF-8, you
could do something like
<pre>
Reader r = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(file), "UTF8");
</pre>
Now you have a Reader <tt>r</tt> that can be passed to the
scanner's constructor in the usual way.
For more information on encodings see also Sun's JDK documentation,
especially in <i>Guide to Features - Java Platform</i> item
<i>Internationalization</i> and there the <i>FAQ</i> and <i>Supported Encodings</i>.

<b>JFlex generates with 0 errors, 0 warnings, but the generated code does not compile</b>
<UL>
If you are sure that the problem is because of JFlex and not because of user code
in the specification, try to run JFlex without the JIT compiler. Some versions of
Sun's JIT compiler sunwjit in JDK 1.2.2 on Solaris 7/Intel seem to have a bug that is triggered by
JFlex (if your scanner compiles ok, there should be no problem). 
<center>
<b>Please do report this as a bug to <a href="mailto:lsf@jflex.de">lsf@jflex.de</a> in any case.</b>
</center>
If there is a problem with a specific platform/JDK/JIT combination it may be important
for other people to know. Also, I might be able to work around the JIT bug from the JFlex side.
