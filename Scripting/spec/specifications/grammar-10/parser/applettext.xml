      <p>This page is meant to be a tool for readers and parser implementers of 
      <ref type="spec"/>. 
      It allows them to type in an expression, and then view the parse tree, or else 
      obtain an error if it is syntactically incorrect.  
      The results should not be used as an absolute reference, and may flag legal 
      syntax or errors not intended by the drafts.  
      However, the parser used was generated by processing the <ref type="grammar-xml"/>, which 
      is also used to produce the EBNF productions in the XPath and XQuery drafts.  
      This parser is also used by the working groups to validate the integrity of the 
      grammar.  Implementers may wish to download the XPath 2.0/XQuery 1.0 Parser Build,
      <ref type="build-zip"/>, if they are interested in the parser production, and more 
      details of this process.  The JavaCC/JJTree files are at <ref type="jjfiles"/>.
