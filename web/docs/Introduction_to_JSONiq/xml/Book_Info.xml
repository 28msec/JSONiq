			JSONiq is a query and processing language specifically designed for the popular JSON data model. The main ideas behind JSONiq are based on lessons learned in more than 30 years of relational query systems and more than 15 years of experience with designing and implementing query languages for semi-structured data. As a result, JSONiq is an expressive and highly optimizable language to query and update any kind of JSONiq store or resource. It enables developers to leverage the same productive high-level language across a variety of NoSQL products. This book gives a complete introduction to the JSONiq language. It does so by giving examples for all types of expressions and functions. Those examples can be immediately used because they work standalone, which allows the interested reader to start diving into the language.
