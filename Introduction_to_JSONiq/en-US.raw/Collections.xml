  <title>Collections</title>
  <para>Even though you can build your own JSON values with JSONiq by copying-and-pasting JSON
    documents, most of the time, your JSON data will be in a collection.</para>
  <para>We now introduce collections, because collections are perfect to illustrate the JSON navigation
  syntax which will be introduced in the next section.</para>
  <para> Collections are sequences of objects, identified by a name which is a string.</para>
  <para>Adding or deleting collections from the set of known collections to a query processor, and
    loading the data in a collection are implementation-dependent and outside of the scope of this
    book.</para>
  <para>We will just assume that there is a function named collection() that returns all objects associated with the provided collection
    name.</para>
  <example>
    <title>Getting all objects from a collection.</title>
    <programlisting>
collection("one-object")
    </programlisting>
  </example>
  <section>
    <title>Collections Used Throughout This Book</title>
    <para>For illustrative purposes, we will assume that we have the following collections:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>collection("one-object")</emphasis></para>
        <example>
          <title>The object in the one-object collection.</title>
          <programlisting>
collection("one-object")
          </programlisting>
        </example>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>collection("faqs")</emphasis> - this is a collection of StackOverflow FAQs.</para>
        <example>
          <title>One object from the faqs collection.</title>
          <programlisting>
collection("faqs")[1]
          </programlisting>
        </example>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>collection("answers")</emphasis> - this is a collection of StackOverflow answers (to the previous FAQs).</para>
        <example>
          <title>One object from the answers collection.</title>
          <programlisting>
collection("answers")[1]
          </programlisting>
        </example>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   <para>Many queries in this book can be directly input into 28.io's try-it-now sandbox, as these collections are preloaded (this is real-world data).</para>
