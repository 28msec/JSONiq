		      <simplelist>
		        <member>Added static (Compilation/Schema soundness) and dynamic (annotation) errors.</member>
		        <member>Forced a Derived Type's facets to always be more restrictive that its Base Type's.</member>
		        <member>Cleaned up a redundancy between Validation and Annotation phases. The Validation Phase does not raise a dynamic error, but simply returns false if validation fails. The intent is that the
		          Annotation phase can then be used to get information about the validation issues.</member>
		        <member>In case of an error, the Annotation phase also provides a $reason field in the error value. The intent is to specify against which Facet validation failed.</member>
		        <member>Object and array subtyping is now allowed.</member>
            <member>Added the type against which Schema Documents are valid in the Schema of Schemas.</member>

		      <simplelist>
		        <member>Added constraints on $content and $open for objects, to ensure proper object-oriented inheritance. But for the moment,
		          object derivation is limited to the topmost type, so that these constraints are trivially fulfilled.</member>
		        <member>Fixed typos.</member>
		        <member>Cleaned up Schema Schema.</member>

		        <member>Annotating an atomic means casting it.</member>
		        <member>The lexical space of date/dateTime/time was extended to support RFC 2822.</member>
		        <member>Local types have no prefix.</member>
		        <member>The URI Qualified Name syntax may also be used to reference types.</member>
		        <member>$optional is ignored if a $default is provided for a pair.</member>
		        <member>Added $about field to Schema and Types for free content.</member>
		        <member>The Input of the Validation and Annotation processes is now a JDM instance (typically freshly parsed).</member>
		        <member>$layout and $member-types were renamed to $content</member>
		        <member>The special key $any was removed from object $content. JSONiq constraints can be used instead.</member>
		        <member>Default values can be computed with a JSONiq query.</member>
