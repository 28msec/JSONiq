    <title>Scope</title>
    <para>The value space of a Union Type is the union of the value spaces of all its member types.</para>
    <para>There is no Builtin Union Type. All Union Types have directly the topmost "item" as their base type and
    restrict the value space by specifying the $content facet. General facets can also be used.</para>
