    <title>Scope</title>
    <para>Array Types match arrays.</para>
    <para>There is one builtin topmost Array Type "array".</para>
    <para>An Array Type can be defined by restricting the value space of an array Base Type by specifying
      a layout (type of the members) or size bounds.
      A restriction can also be made with the general Types facets $enumeration and $constraints.</para>

    <title>Builtin Array Type</title>
    <para>There is one topmost, builtin Array Type named <emphasis>array</emphasis>, against which all arrays are valid.</para> 
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Array facets</title>
    <para>
      Restriction is done using the general facets, or the following array facets.
    </para>
    <para>JSound supports the following array facets.</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>$content (singleton array of one string or object) : the name of a Type (Qualified Name in a string) or the type itself (an object) that all members must match.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>$minLength (integer) : the minimum length.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>$maxLength (integer) : the maximum length.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The above three facets behave like normal Facets, i.e., <code>jsd:JDST0007</code> is raised if they are already defined by their
    Base Type, and redefined by the Derived Type in a less restrictive way.</para>
